# svelte-labsystem

This is a Svelte implementation of Labcodes' design system.

We require svelte 3.27 or above, and [SASS](https://daveceddia.com/svelte-with-sass-in-vscode/) and [TypeScript](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript) support in your project. Both are pretty simple to set up :]

The components are strictly the same as the React implementation, which means you can take a look at them in our [React storybook app](https://labstorybook-master.netlify.app/).
