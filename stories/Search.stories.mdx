The search component should be used for searching contents within a website or an app. We can have 2 types
of search components: Standard and Inline.

## Anatomy

### Field elements

## Standard Search

It's a standard input linked to a search button. It should be used when the design needs more
emphasis in the search funcionality. This search suggests results in an autocomplete dropdown and, for more detailed answers,
it can take the user to another page.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Standard Search">
    <StandardSearch />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Inline Search

Similar to the <a href="https://labstorybook-master.netlify.app/?path=/docs/components-text-input">text with trailing icon input</a>. It should be used when the design needs a more compact and clean
component. This search works filtering the results and showing them simultaneously as the user types.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Inline Search">
    <InlineSearch />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Behavior
<div class="columns">
  <div class="column">
    <h3>Standard Search</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>If the page have the search funcionality as the main purpose, the seach field should be focused by default. If not, focus to activate it. </li>
      <li>With the field focused, type the query.</li>
      <li>"X" icon apears at the right corner of the text input, and it can be clicked at any moment to clear whatever was typed. Pressing the <code>ESC</code> key also clears the input value.</li>
      <li>An autocomplete dropdown should appear under the search input.</li>
      <li>Click on the search button / press enter to trigger the search action or choose a result of the autocomplete dropdown and click on it.</li>
      <li>Click outside the component if you want to unfocus the input without triggering the search action, but keeping the typed text. </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h3>Inline Search</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Focus the inline seach field.</li>
      <li>Type the query.</li>
      <li>The results should appear as the keyword is typed and should behave as a filtered search.</li>
      <li>Click on the "X" icon or press the <code>ESC</code> key to clear the input value.</li>
      <li>Click outside the component if you want to unfocus the input.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

## Theming

For Search component, you can also use purple theme. The theme must be selected by changing the value of the `$input-theme` variable in the `scss/variables/_settings.scss`.
