      <h2>Universality and Diversity</h2>
      <p>Our products are made by us and for us, a diverse, focused, and fun group.

        <li>Be collaborative and keep management tools up to date</li>
        <li>Always respect Web Accessibility Standards and Universal Design guidelines</li>

      <h2>Sustainability and Autonomy</h2>
      <p>As a small team with high performance, we must be able to comprehend interactions regardless of previous experiences with the product. Therefore, our designs must always guarantee autonomy, velocity, scalability, and easy maintenance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Respect reality and its limitations but carry on! Be transparent about possibilities and limitations of each interaction</li>
        <li>Use modules consistent with each other, in a familiar and replicable manner</li>
        <li>Make safe and positive interactions easy, whereas on risky interactions provide clear instructions to convey confidence on decision making</li>
        <li>Optimize important tasks without blocking the less important ones</li>

      <h2>Clarity and Minimalism</h2>
      <p>We are a creative team but, above all, assertive. To achieve that, focus on the essential for communication, workflows, and aesthetics. Everything should have a purpose, be it completing a task-flow or delight the user.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be creative but keep it tidy. Organization and modularity are essential to keep the product simple and familiar both to the team and its users</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive use of colors, images or ornaments. Easter-eggs are welcomed, but only if they don't distract users from their goals</li>
        <li>Minimize choices and complexity. Break tasks and/or automatize processes whenever possible</li>
        <li>Keep access for advanced or less used interactions but with lower emphasis on the interface</li>

      <h2>Recognition</h2>
      <p>We are proud and celebrate who we are, always expressing our better selves. Therefore, it is important that the brand style and personality is represented in our product's style and tone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always follow brand and styles guidelines to keep the product consistent and memorable</li>
        <li>Always deliver the best practices available</li>
