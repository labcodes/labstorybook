      <h2>Storybook</h2>
      <p>Currently, all our codebase, including both the storybook and the Confetti's own source code, are on the same repository. You can visit it on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/labcodes/labstorybook/">Github</a>.</p>
      <p>To set up the storybook, clone the repository, then, with node and npm installed, run <code>npm install</code>.</p>
      <p>With that done, you'll need to enter the <code>labsystem</code> folder (by running <code>cd labsystem</code>), and run <code>npm install</code> again, since this folder contains the source code for the design system itself. Labsystem is the old name for our design system, and will be changed in the future, along with these docs.</p>
      <h3>Running the storybook locally</h3>
      <p>After setting it up, to run the storybook locally, go to the root folder (the one that contains the <code>.storybook</code> folder) and run <code>npm start</code>. That will run a development server that runs at http://localhost:8000 and that constains this whole storybook site.</p>
      <h3>Running the tests</h3>
      <p>To manually run the tests, first go into the <code>labsystem</code> folder, then run <code>npm test</code>. The tests will also be automatically run before any push is made to the Github repository.</p>
      <h3>Deploying staging apps</h3>
      <p>If you have made any changes to the Storybook's or Confetti's source code and want to share it with other people for QA, just push your branch and Netlify will automatically deploy it to https://your-branch-name--labstorybook-master.netlify.app after a few minutes. When it's merged on master, it will be available at the base https://labstorybook-master.netlify.app url.</p>
