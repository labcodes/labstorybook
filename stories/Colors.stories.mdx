      <p>Main color of branding, communication and product.</p>
      <p>The centerpoint of Labcodes color palette to preserve its identity in a constant evolving world. Represents the diversity, uniquiness and vibrancy of our organization.</p>

  <h2>The Complete Palette</h2>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p>We have a palette composed of two main colors, the ones present in our logo, <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span> and <span class="u-color-secondary">coral</span>, both complementary to each other, one support and one additional color to make the way we show things more colorful, plural and interesting: <span class="u-color-support">purple</span> and <span class="u-color-additional">mustard</span>, respectively, and also complementary.</p>
      
      <p>The gray stack, composes our neutral color base for use as texts and backgrounds. <span class="u-color-neutral">Mineral</span> is a cool gray color shade that pairs perfectly with all of our color stacks. Mineral also includes pure white and black.</p>

  <h3>Color Pairing</h3>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p>If the difference between two values is 50 or greater, the colors are accessible and can be used overlapping each other (text over bg, e.g.)</p>
      
      <p>If the difference value is 30, large text can be used, but it may fail accessibility standards. A double check is recommended.</p>
      
      <ul>
        ​​<li>Standard text and images of text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.</li>
        ​​<li>Large text, at least 24px regular/light or 19px semibold, a contrast ratio of 3:1.</li>
        <li>Visual information used to indicate states and boundaries of UI components also 3:1.</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Color Families</h3>
  <p>The color palette has been organized into 2 distinct families, both containing the Labcodes <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span> stack.</p>

  <h4>Mkt Family</h4>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p>The Mkt, or Marketing family brings together all color stacks for use in institutional digital or printed/physical pieces, for example: sketchbooks, social media, website, banners, furniture, etc.</p>
      
      <p>The main colors to use are <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span> and <span class="u-color-secondary">coral</span>, but remember our brand color is <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span>. Both colors should preferably be applied in their default tones <code>-40</code>. If their use is not possible due to contrast issues, for example, use a darker shade like <code>-60</code>.</p>
      
      <p><span class="u-color-support">Purple</span> is set to be used as a secondary color for mixing with <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span> and <span class="u-color-secondary">coral</span>.</p>
      
      <p><span class="u-color-additional">Yellow</span> is the additional color, for use mostly in the lighter shades (less or equal to <code>-40</code>), in pair with <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span>, <span class="u-color-secondary">coral</span> or <span class="u-color-support">purple</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">

    </div>
  </div>

  <h4>App Family</h4>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p>The App, or Application family unites the brand color <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span> with support color <span class="u-color-support">purple</span> and <span class="u-color-neutral">mineral</span> neutrals. The color system for digital products is derived from the complete color palette. On default light and dark themes, <span class="u-color-neutral">mineral</span> is meant to be the dominant stack, making use of subtle shade variations to help organize content into distinct areas.</p>
      
      <p>The <span class="u-color-primary">teal</span> stack is set to be the primary action and highlight color and <span class="u-color-support">purple</span> as secondary highlight and also action.</p>
      
      <p>In addition for on-screen messages and special UI features and support, there are specific dual-tone color stacks.</p>

  <h4>Light and Dark Themes</h4>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p>Mineral light and dark themes work as an organizational scheme for color, with each theme instance able to function independently on the primary background color choice. Mineral Light can be used with <code>>$mineral-10</code> or <code>$white</code> backgrounds, while Mineral Dark apps can be designed using <code>$mineral-90</code> or <code>$black</code> backgrounds.</p>
